##What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
I'm going to ignore the missing values in the dataset.
1.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
steps.date<-aggregate(steps~date,data=activity, FUN=sum)
barplot(steps.date$steps, names.arg=steps.date$date, xlab="date", ylab="steps", main="Total number of steps taken each day")
```
2.Calculate and report the *mean* and *median* total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean(steps.date$steps)
median(steps.date$steps)
```
##What is the average daily activity pattern?
1.Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r}
steps.interval<-aggregate(steps~interval,data=activity, FUN=mean)
plot(steps.interval, main="Average daily activity pattern", type="l")
```
2.Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
steps.interval$interval[which.max(steps.interval$steps)]
```
##Imputing missing values
1.Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
```{r}
sum(is.na(activity))
```
2.Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
I'm going to use the mean for the 5-minute intervals.
3.Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r}
activity<-merge(activity, steps.interval, by="interval", suffixes=c("", ".y"))
nas<-is.na(activity$steps)

nas<-is.na(activity$steps)
activity$steps[nas]<-activity$steps.y[nas]
activity<-activity[,c(1:3)]
```
4.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
```{r}
steps.date<-aggregate(steps~date, data=activity, FUN=sum)
